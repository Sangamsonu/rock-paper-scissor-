Project Paper: Rock-Paper-Scissors Game

Introduction

The rock-paper-scissors game is a popular game that is played by people of all ages. It is a game of chance where two players simultaneously make hand gestures that correspond to rock, paper, or scissors. The game is won by the player who makes a gesture that defeats the gesture made by the other player. In this project, we will create a rock-paper-scissors game using Python programming language.

Objectives

The main objective of this project is to create a simple rock-paper-scissors game using Python. The game should allow the user to play against the computer, keep track of scores across multiple rounds, and give the user the option to play multiple rounds.

Methodology

To achieve our objective, we will write a Python program that will take input from the user and generate random output for the computer. The program will include conditional statements that will check for different possible outcomes and determine the winner of each round.

The first step will be to define a function called "game" that will take the computer's choice and the user's choice as input and determine the winner of the round. The function will include conditional statements to check for different possible outcomes. If the computer's choice and the user's choice are the same, the function will return a draw. If the computer's choice beats the user's choice, the function will return a win for the computer. If the user's choice beats the computer's choice, the function will return a win for the user.

The next step will be to create a loop that will allow the user to play multiple rounds of the game. The loop will include a counter that will keep track of the number of rounds played and a variable that will keep track of the user's score. The loop will continue until the user chooses to stop playing.

After each round, the program will display the computer's choice and the user's choice, as well as the outcome of the round. The program will also update the user's score and display it at the end of each round.

Conclusion

In conclusion, this project will create a simple rock-paper-scissors game using Python programming language. The game will allow the user to play against the computer, keep track of scores across multiple rounds, and give the user the option to play multiple rounds. The game will serve as a good introduction to Python programming and demonstrate the use of conditional statements and loops.
